# OWASP Non-Human Identities Top 10

The primary goal of the "OWASP Non-Human Identities Top 10" document is to provide assistance and education for organizations looking to secure the non-human identities in their organization's environment. The guide provides information about what the most prominent security risks are for such identities, the challenges involved, and how to overcome them.
